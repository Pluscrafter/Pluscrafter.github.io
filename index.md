## Home

I'm interested in electronics and programming and this is my website for all projects that I started from now on. You can also star this [project](https://github.com/D3PSI/nautilus) from my friend that started a project for a simple graphics engine on all platforms with Vulkan and OpenGL. 

Also I will get maybe my CEPT/HB9 Licence for amateur radio in december. Maybe there will also be some topics about this project. 

### Why a Website?
Why not there are so many in the net, but so I can express my ideas and my hobbies and maybe help someone with a problem in this field. Also you can communicate with other fellows in your field of interest.

I host my website with Github because it's free. I can only create static sites but this is enought for my needs.
